# Battleships

The Battleship is a strategic game revolving around guessing where the enemy placed their ships and attempt to sink them all, the player who sinks all enemy ships wins. In our iteration of the game, you are playing against an AI opponent and you can play from both in the web-app created in Python with the use of Flask framework as well as in the command-line by running the "mp_game_engine.py" file.

## Installation

Battleships requires the following modules to be installed:
- Flask
- pytest

The versions of the packages can be seen in setup.py

## Gameplay

Follow the following steps to run the game in your browser:
1. Run the main.py file to run the flask web app on your local server
2. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/placement
3. Place the battleships on your board and click on the "Send board" button
4. Play the game
5. The game ends when one of the players destroys all the enemy's battleships 

## Roadmap

In future versions, an upgrade in AI battleships' placement and its choice of place to attack is to be improved. A multiplayer mode allowing to play against friends from far away is also currently under consideration.
